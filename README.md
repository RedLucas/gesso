# Gesso

Gesso is a [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)-based starter theme that outputs
accessible HTML5 markup. It uses a mobile-first responsive approach and
leverages [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/) to organize styles as outlined in the
[Drupal 8 CSS architecture guidelines](https://www.drupal.org/node/1887918).
This encourages a component-based approach to theming through the creation of
discrete, reusable UI elements.

For a full description of this theme, view the
[Gesso project page](https://drupal.org/project/gesso/). To submit bug reports
or feature requests, visit the
[Gesso issue queue](https://drupal.org/project/issues/gesso/).
